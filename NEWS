momentuHMM 2.0.0 2025-04-29
-----------------
NEW FEATURES

* many (but not all) models can now be fitted using the optimization routine of TMB by setting optMethod='TMB'

* continuous-time hidden Markov models can now be fitted using 'fitCTHMM' (and 'MIfitCTHMM') and simulated using 'simCTHMM' (or 'simHierCTHMM' for hierarchical continuous-time models)

* new data stream distributions "crwrice" and "crwvm" for correlated step lengths and turn angles, respectively

* new data stream distribution "ctcrw" for a discrete-time approximation of the continuous-time correlated random walk (CTCRW) of Johnson et al. (2008)

* new data stream distribution "ctds" for (multistate) continuous-time discrete-space movement models, which can be prepared, fitted, and simulated using the functions 'prepCTDS', 'fitCTHMM' (or 'MIfitCTHMM'), and 'simCTDS' (or 'simHierCTDS' for hierarchical models), respectively.

* special formula function 'langevin' has been added for simulating and fitting discrete-time approximations of the (multistate) Langevin diffusion model as a multivariate normal random walk (i.e. using the "rw_mvnorm2" or "rw_mvnorm3" data stream distributions)

* 'mask' argument added to 'simData' functions for prohibiting movements into particular raster cells (e.g. land or water)

* 'export' argument added to simulation functions for exporting formula objects from the global environment when ncores>1

* 'colors' argument added to 'plotSpatialCov' function for specifying raster colors

* 'gradient' argument added to 'prepData' and 'simData' functions for calculating gradients of spatial covariates using bilinear interpolation

* 'addSmoothGradient' function can be used to calculate a smoothed version of the gradient of spatial covariates

* 'ncores' argument added to 'fitHMM' (and 'fitCTHMM') functions for attempting 'retryFits' in parallel

* 'matchModelObs' argument added to simulation functions when simulating from a fitted model

* 'CT', 'Time.name', and 'Time.unit' arguments added to 'prepData' function for preparing continuous-time HMM data

* 'BIC' and 'BICweights' functions have been added for calculating the Bayesian Information Criterion

CHANGES

* multivariate normal data stream distributions (e.g., 'mvnorm2', 'rw_mvnorm2') are now parameterized and ordered in terms of means (e.g., 'mean.x', 'mean.y'), standard deviations (e.g., 'sd.x', 'sd.y'), and correlations (e.g. 'corr.xy')

* when the probability density for a data stream observation is zero for all states, a warning is triggered and .Machine$double.xmin is used to avoid division by zero within the forward algorithm

* 'fixPar' argument cannot be specified for circular distribution parameters unless 'DM' is also specified

* 'initialValues' (Par0, beta0, delta0) are now returned in 'conditions' list of 'momentuHMM' objects

* when 'prior' argument of 'fitHMM' is specified, only the (unpenalized) likelihood is used for Hessian and AIC calculations

* in 'prepData' function, the minimum number of observations per animal is now two (instead of three)

BUG FIXES

* for multivariate normal data streams, pseudo-residuals were improperly calculated using a chi-square CDF ('qchisq') instead of the standard normal CDF ('qnorm')

* getParDM did not properly calculate working scale parameters for categorical distribution parameters when DM included covariates or constraints

* since momentuHMM v1.5.1, 'toState' special formula function did not work properly unless 'betaRef' argument was specified in fitHMM (or MIfitHMM)


momentuHMM 1.5.5 2022-10-18
-----------------
CHANGES

* raster package moved to Imports as it is no longer imported by crawl>=2.3.0


momentuHMM 1.5.4 2021-09-02
-----------------
NEW FEATURES

* CIreal argument 'm' will now accept a 'miHMM' object

CHANGES

* removed implicit conversions in C++ code that triggered compilation warnings on macOS with -Wconversion -Wno-sign-conversion in CPPFLAGS

BUG FIXES

* when using the normal random walk data stream distributions ("rw_norm", "rw_mvnorm2", or "rw_mvnorm3") in fitHMM (and MIfitHMM), any additional data streams were erroneously offset by one time step during model fitting; previous analyses using a normal random walk data stream in addition to any other data stream(s) should be re-run

* CIreal produced an error when the 'm' argument was a 'miSum' object


momentuHMM 1.5.3 2021-07-06
-----------------
NEW FEATURES

* 'return' argument added to plotStationary function for returning stationary probabilities, standards errors, and confidence intervals as a list

* progress bar added when using doFuture parallel backend

CHANGES

* doFuture is now the default parallel backend; to run functions with ncores>1, the doFuture and future packages must be installed

* data stream names can no longer be 'beta', 'delta', 'pi', 'g0', or 'theta'

* data stream names can no longer begin with 'beta', 'delta', 'g0', or 'theta'

* added additional checks for unused arguments passed down from a calling function (e.g. fitHMM, prepData); these were previously ignored

* added additional checks for undefined data stream or parameter names in common list arguments (e.g. DM, workBounds, userBounds); these were previously ignored

* the following packages have been moved to 'Suggests' and are now used conditionally: car, data.tree, extraDistr, geosphere, mitools, nleqslv, prodlim, qdapRegex, and survival. If any of these are packages needed, users will be prompted to install.

BUG FIXES

* In fitHMM and MIfitHMM, an error is now triggered if a covariate (e.g. 'cov1') used in formula, formulaDelta, formulaPi, or DM is missing from the data and a variable with the same name (e.g. 'cov1') exists in the (global) environment. In momentuHMM <=1.5.2, internal calls to stats::model.matrix(formula, data) with missing covariates in the data would attempt to use the (global) environment variable with no warning or error, which could be problematic.


momentuHMM 1.5.2 2021-01-06
-----------------
NEW FEATURES

* Approximate individual-level random effects estimation for the state transition probabilities based on Burnham & White (2002) can now be implemented via the randomEffects function

* ncores argument added to simData and simHierData for simulating individual tracks in parallel

CHANGES

* Viterbi algorithm for discrete random effect models (with mixtures>1) now uses individual mixture probabilities instead of overall mixture probabilities

* plotPR now uses car::qqPlot for pseudo-residual qq-plots

* the following packages have been moved to 'Suggests' and are now used conditionally: BB, conicfit, dplyr, expm, ggmap, ggplot2, lubridate, magrittr, matrixcalc, moveHMM, raster, and scatterplot3d. If any of these are packages needed, users will be prompted to install.

* suppress 'Unknown or uninitialised column' warning in crawlWrap when obsData is an sf object

* removed initial SANN optimization when using retryFits in crawlWrap

* reduced worker memory pressure when running crawlWrap or MIfitHMM in parallel

* deprecated cons and workcons arguments are now defunct; please use workBounds instead

* deprecated verbose argument in fitHMM and MIfitHMM is now defunct; please use nlmPar instead

BUG FIXES

* mixtureProbs function did not properly account for individual covariates in DM argument when mixtures>1; hence estimated mixture and state probabilities were incorrect for discrete random effect models in momentuHMM <= 1.5.1 if individual covariates were included on any data stream distribution parameters

* mixtureProbs function produced an error when initial distribution formula includes covariates

* avoid numerical underflow in mixtureProbs when a mixture probability is zero

* crawlWrap now internally deals with a long-standing bug in crawl::crwPredict when predTime argument includes prediction times before the first observation

* overly restrictive check for time-varying covariates in fitHMM when stationary=TRUE


momentuHMM 1.5.1 2020-03-04
-----------------
CHANGES

* stationary argument in fitHMM and MIfitHMM can now be set to TRUE when there are no time-varying covariates included in formula; in this case the initial distribution is calculated independently for each individual

* in prepData, data streams can now be named 'step' and/or 'angle' when coordNames=NULL

BUG FIXES

* fitHMM and MIfitHMM argument 'retryFits' failed to randomly perturb parameter values in momentuHMM 1.5.0

* 'cat' (categorical), 'logis' (logistic), 'negbinom' (negative binomial), and 't' (non-central t) data stream distributions have been added

* circularAngleMean can now alternatively be used to specify the reference angle (i.e. directional persistence) coefficient in circular-circular regression models

* added getTrProbs and mixtureProbs functions for calculating transition and mixture probabilities, respectively

* added na.rm argument to MIpool and MIfitHMM for excluding model fits with NA estimates or standard errors from pooling
