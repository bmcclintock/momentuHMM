abstract = {Summary
Urban environments are high risk areas for large carnivores, where anthropogenic disturbances can reduce fitness and increase mortality risk.1 When catastrophic events like large wildfires occur, trade-offs between acquiring resources and avoiding risks of the urban environment are intensified. This landscape context could lead to an increase in risk-taking behavior by carnivores if burned areas do not allow them to meet their energetic needs, potentially leading to human-wildlife conflict.2,3 We studied mountain lion behavior using GPS location and accelerometer data from 17 individuals tracked before and after a large wildfire (the 2018 Woolsey Fire) within a highly urbanized area (Los Angeles, California, USA). After the wildfire, mountain lions avoided burned areas and increased behaviors associated with anthropogenic risk, including more frequent road and freeway crossings (mean crossings increased from 3 to 5 per month) and greater activity during the daytime (means from increased 10% to 16% of daytime active), a time when they are most likely to encounter humans. Mountain lions also increased their amount of space used, distance traveled (mean distances increased from 250 to 390 km per month), and intrasexual overlap, potentially putting them at risk of intraspecific conflict. Joint pressures from urbanization and severe wildfire, alongside resulting risk-taking, could thus increase mortality and extinction risk for populations already suffering from low genetic diversity, necessitating increased connectivity in fire-prone areas.}

abstract = {Abstract Ecological systems can often be characterised by changes among a finite set of underlying states pertaining to individuals, populations, communities or entire ecosystems through time. Owing to the inherent difficulty of empirical field studies, ecological state dynamics operating at any level of this hierarchy can often be unobservable or ‘hidden’. Ecologists must therefore often contend with incomplete or indirect observations that are somehow related to these underlying processes. By formally disentangling state and observation processes based on simple yet powerful mathematical properties that can be used to describe many ecological phenomena, hidden Markov models (HMMs) can facilitate inferences about complex system state dynamics that might otherwise be intractable. However, HMMs have only recently begun to gain traction within the broader ecological community. We provide a gentle introduction to HMMs, establish some common terminology, review the immense scope of HMMs for applied ecological research and provide a tutorial on implementation and interpretation. By illustrating how practitioners can use a simple conceptual template to customise HMMs for their specific systems of interest, revealing methodological links between existing applications, and highlighting some practical considerations and limitations of these approaches, our goal is to help establish HMMs as a fundamental inferential tool for ecologists.},

abstract = {Abstract The behavior of many wild animals remains a mystery, as it is difficult to quantify behavior of species that cannot be easily followed throughout their daily or seasonal movements. Accelerometers can solve some of these mysteries, as they collect activity data at a high temporal resolution (<1 s), can be relatively small (<1 g) so they minimally disrupt behavior, and are increasingly capable of recording data for long periods. Nonetheless, there is a need for increased validation of methods to classify animal behavior from accelerometers to promote widespread adoption of this technology in ecology. We assessed the accuracy of six different behavioral assignment methods for two species of seabird, thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). We identified three behaviors using tri-axial accelerometers: standing, swimming, and flying, after classifying diving using a pressure sensor for murres. We evaluated six classification methods relative to independent classifications from concurrent GPS tracking data. We used four variables for classification: depth, wing beat frequency, pitch, and dynamic acceleration. Average accuracy for all methods was >98\% for murres, and 89\% and 93\% for kittiwakes during incubation and chick rearing, respectively. Variable selection showed that classification accuracy did not improve with more than two (kittiwakes) or three (murres) variables. We conclude that simple methods of behavioral classification can be as accurate for classifying basic behaviors as more complex approaches, and that identifying suitable accelerometer metrics is more important than using a particular classification method when the objective is to develop a daily activity or energy budget. Highly accurate daily activity budgets can be generated from accelerometer data using multiple methods and a small number of accelerometer metrics; therefore, identifying a suitable behavioral classification method should not be a barrier to using accelerometers in studies of seabird behavior and ecology.},

abstract = {Abstract Recent advances in biologging open promising perspectives in the study of animal movements at numerous scales. It is now possible to record time series of animal locations and ancillary data (e.g. activity level derived from on-board accelerometers) over extended areas and long durations with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Such time series are often piecewise stationary, as the animal may alternate between different stationary phases (i.e. characterized by a specific mean and variance of some key parameter for limited periods). Identifying when these phases start and end is a critical first step to understand the dynamics of the underlying movement processes. We introduce a new segmentation-clustering method we called segclust2d (available as a r package at cran.r-project.org/package=segclust2d). It can segment bivariate (or more generally multivariate) time series and possibly cluster the various segments obtained, corresponding to different phases assumed to be stationary. This method is easy to use, as it only requires specifying a minimum segment length (to prevent over-segmentation), based on biological rather than statistical considerations. This method can be applied to bivariate piecewise time series of any nature. We focus here on two types of time series related to animal movement, corresponding to (a) at large scale, series of bivariate coordinates of relocations, to highlight temporary home ranges, and (b) at smaller scale, bivariate series derived from relocations data, such as speed and turning angle, to highlight different behavioural modes such as transit, feeding and resting. Using computer simulations, we show that segclust2d can rival and even outperform previous, more complex methods, which were specifically developed to highlight changes of movement modes or home range shifts (based on hidden Markov and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck modelling), which, contrary to our method, usually require the user to provide relevant initial guesses to be efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate it on actual examples involving a zebra's small-scale movements and an elephant's large-scale movements, to illustrate how various movement modes and home range shifts, respectively, can be identified.},

    abstract = { Seabirds must often travel vast distances to exploit heterogeneously distributed oceanic resources, but how routes and destinations of foraging trips are optimized remains poorly understood. Among the seabirds, gadfly petrels (Pterodroma spp.) are supremely adapted for making efficient use of wind energy in dynamic soaring flight. We used GPS tracking data to investigate the role of wind in the flight behaviour and foraging strategy of the Desertas petrel, Pterodroma deserta. We found that rather than visiting foraging hotspots, Desertas petrels maximize prey encounter by covering some of the longest distances known in any animal in a single foraging trip (up to 12 000 km) over deep, pelagic waters. Petrels flew with consistent crosswind (relative wind angle 60°), close to that which maximizes their groundspeed. By combining state–space modelling with a series of comparisons to simulated foraging trips (reshuffled-random, rotated, time-shifted, reversed), we show that this resulted in trajectories that were close to the fastest possible, given the location and time. This wind use is thus consistent both with birds using current winds to fine-tune their routes and, impressively, with an a priori knowledge of predictable regional-scale wind regimes, facilitating efficient flight over great distances before returning to the home colony. }

ABSTRACT={Long-distance seed dispersal is an important ecosystem service provided by migratory animals. Plants inhabiting discrete habitats, like lakes and wetlands, experience dispersal limitation, and rely heavily on zoochory for their spatial population dynamics. Granivorous waterbirds may disperse viable seeds of wetland plants over long distances during migration. The limited knowledge of waterbird migration has long hampered the evaluation of the importance of waterbirds in seed dispersal, requiring key metrics such as realistic dispersal distances. Using recent GPS tracking of mallards during spring migration, we built a mechanistic seed dispersal model to estimate realistic dispersal distances. Mallards are abundant, partially migratory ducks known to consume seeds of >300 European plant species. Based on the tracking data, we informed a mallard migration simulator to obtain a probabilistic spring migration model for the mallard population wintering at Lake Constance in Southern Germany. We combined the spring migration model with seed retention curves to develop seed dispersal kernels. We also assessed the effects of pre-migratory fasting and the availability of suitable deposition habitats for aquatic and wetland plants. Our results show that mallards at Lake Constance can disperse seeds in the northeastern direction over median distances of 293 and 413 km for seeds with short and long retention times, respectively, assuming a departure immediately after foraging. Pre-migratory fasting strongly affected the dispersal potential, with only 1–7% of ingested seeds left for dispersal after fasting for 12 h. Availability of a suitable deposition habitat was generally <5% along the migratory flyway. The high probability of seed deposition in a freshwater habitat during the first stopover, after the mallards completed the first migratory flight, makes successful dispersal most likely to happen at 204–322 km from Lake Constance. We concluded that the directed long-distance dispersal of plant seeds, realized by mallards on spring migration, may contribute significantly to large scale spatial plant population dynamics, including range expansion in response to shifting temperature and rainfall patterns under global warming. Our dispersal model is the first to incorporate detailed behavior of migratory waterbirds and can be readily adjusted to include other vector species when tracking data are available.}

abstract = {Abstract Long-term bio-logging has the potential to reveal how movements, and hence life-history trade-offs, vary over a lifetime. Reproductive tactics in particular may vary as individuals' trade-off current investment versus lifetime fitness. Male African savanna elephants (Loxodona africana) provide a telling example of balancing body growth with reproductive fitness due to the combination of indeterminate growth and strongly delineated periods of sexual activity (musth), which results in reproductive tactics that alter with age. Our study aims to quantify the extent to which male elephants alter their movement patterns, and hence energetic allocation, in relation to (a) reproductive state and (b) age, and (c) to determine whether musth periods can be detected directly from GPS tracking data. We used a combination of GPS tracking data and visual observations of 25 male elephants ranging in age from 20 to 52 years to examine the influence of reproductive state and age on movement. We then used a three-state hidden Markov model (HMM) to detect musth behaviour in a subset of sequential tracking data. Our results demonstrate that male elephants increased their daily mean speed and range size with age and in musth. Furthermore, non-musth speed decreased with age, presumably reflecting a shift towards energy acquisition during non-musth. Thus, despite similar speeds and marginally larger ranges between reproductive states at age 20, by age 50, males were travelling 2.0 times faster in a 3.5 times larger area in musth relative to non-musth. The distinctiveness of musth periods over age 35 meant the three-state HMM could automatically detect musth movement with high sensitivity and specificity, but could not for the younger age class. We show that male elephants increased their energetic allocation into reproduction with age as the probability of reproductive success increases. Given that older male elephants tend to be both the target of legal trophy hunting and illegal poaching, man-made interference could drive fundamental changes in elephant reproductive tactics. Bio-logging, as our study reveals, has the potential both to quantify mature elephant reproductive tactics remotely and to be used to institute proactive management strategies around the reproductive behaviour of this charismatic keystone species.},

abstract = {Rapid development of a successful foraging strategy is critical for juvenile survival, especially for naïve animals that receive no parental guidance. However, this process is poorly understood for many species. Although observation of early-life movements is increasingly possible with miniaturisation of animal-borne telemetry devices, analytical limitations remain. Here, we tracked 29 recently-weaned grey seal Halichoerus grypus pups from colonies in two geographically distinct regions of the United Kingdom. We analysed at-sea movements of pups throughout their initial months of nutritional independence to investigate the ontogeny of behaviour-specific (foraging and travelling) movement patterns. Using generalized hidden Markov models (HMMs), we extended the conventional HMM framework to account for temporal changes in putative foraging and travelling movement characteristics, and investigate the effects of intrinsic (sex) and extrinsic (environment) factors on this process. Putative foraging behaviour became more tortuous with time, and travelling became faster and more directed, suggesting a reduction in search scale and an increase in travel efficiency as pups shifted from exploration to an adult-like repeatable foraging strategy. Sex differences in movement characteristics were evident from colony departure, but sex-specific activity budgets were only detected in one region. We show that sex-specific behavioural strategies emerge before sexual size dimorphism in grey seals, and suggest that this phenomenon may occur in other long-lived species. Our results also indicate that environmental variation may affect the emergence of sex-specific foraging behaviour, highlighting the need to consider interacting intrinsic and extrinsic factors in shaping movement strategies of long-lived vertebrates. Moreover, comparing the behavioural state estimations to those of a conventional HMM (no variation in state-specific movement parameters) revealed differences in the amount and location of foraging activity, with implications for spatial conservation management. Overlooking intrinsic and extrinsic variation in movement processes could distort our understanding of foraging ecology, population dynamics and conservation requirements.},

abstract = {Abstract In a highly dynamic airspace, flying animals are predicted to adjust foraging behaviour to variable wind conditions to minimize movement costs. Sexual size dimorphism is widespread in wild animal populations, and for large soaring birds which rely on favourable winds for energy-efficient flight, differences in morphology, wing loading and associated flight capabilities may lead males and females to respond differently to wind. However, the interaction between wind and sex has not been comprehensively tested. We investigated, in a large sexually dimorphic seabird which predominantly uses dynamic soaring flight, whether flight decisions are modulated to variation in winds over extended foraging trips, and whether males and females differ. Using GPS loggers we tracked 385 incubation foraging trips of wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans, for which males are c. 20\% larger than females, from two major populations (Crozet and South Georgia). Hidden Markov models were used to characterize behavioural states—directed flight, area-restricted search (ARS) and resting—and model the probability of transitioning between states in response to wind speed and relative direction, and sex. Wind speed and relative direction were important predictors of state transitioning. Birds were much more likely to take off (i.e. switch from rest to flight) in stronger headwinds, and as wind speeds increased, to be in directed flight rather than ARS. Males from Crozet but not South Georgia experienced stronger winds than females, and males from both populations were more likely to take-off in windier conditions. Albatrosses appear to deploy an energy-saving strategy by modulating taking-off, their most energetically expensive behaviour, to favourable wind conditions. The behaviour of males, which have higher wing loading requiring faster speeds for gliding flight, was influenced to a greater degree by wind than females. As such, our results indicate that variation in flight performance drives sex differences in time–activity budgets and may lead the sexes to exploit regions with different wind regimes.},

We used a relatively new fine-scale acoustic tracking system to quantify movements of an economically valuable, demersal marine fish species (gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus) on a natural hardbottom reef on the continental shelf of North Carolina, USA. Overall, 30 fish were tagged and released, and 104,170 highly precise (˜1–3 m) spatial positions were estimated during the 43-d study. To quantify gray triggerfish movements, we used a combination of exploratory data analyses and hidden Markov models (HMM), the latter of which can identify and elucidate normally hidden behavioral states. Both methods suggested gray triggerfish movements varied by diel period and among individuals, and that some of the variation among individuals could be explained by fish size. Depending on model specification, HMMs identified two or three behavioral states, one of which was likely resting that occurred mostly at night and another was likely foraging or transit that occurred mostly during the day. Moreover, resting at night occurred in small, discrete patches within the study area, whereas foraging or transit behaviors occurred broadly throughout the study area. We encourage a wider use of acoustic telemetry and HMMs to shed light on the normally hidden behaviors of demersal fishes.}

abstract = {Reconstruction of deep-sea cephalopod communities in cetacean foraging zones indicates differentiation on prey size, not species. Fundamental insight on predator-prey dynamics in the deep sea is hampered by a lack of combined data on hunting behavior and prey spectra. Deep-sea niche segregation may evolve when predators target specific prey communities, but this hypothesis remains untested. We combined environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding with biologging to assess cephalopod community composition in the deep-sea foraging habitat of two top predator cetaceans. Risso’s dolphin and Cuvier’s beaked whale selectively targeted distinct epi/meso- and bathypelagic foraging zones, holding eDNA of 39 cephalopod taxa, including 22 known prey. Contrary to expectation, extensive taxonomic overlap in prey spectra between foraging zones indicated that predator niche segregation was not driven by prey community composition alone. Instead, intraspecific prey spectrum differences may drive differentiation for hunting fewer, more calorific, mature cephalopods in deeper waters. The novel combination of methods presented here holds great promise to disclose elusive deep-sea predator-prey systems, aiding in their protection.}}

abstract = {Abstract Fate assignment is crucial to the results of survival studies, particularly those that utilize acoustic tagging. Most current methodologies are at least partially subjective; thus, having a means of objectively assigning fates would improve the precision, accuracy, and utility of such studies. We released 57 acoustically tagged fish belonging to six deepwater grouper species off North Carolina, USA, via surface release and recompressed release with descender devices. We applied a three-state hidden Markov model (HMM) in a novel way: to distinguish movement patterns between fish that were alive and fish that were dead (and might have been eaten by predators). We assigned fates using two approaches that differed in their reliance on HMMs. When HMMs were the predominant source of fate assignment, we estimated survival of 40 deepwater groupers released with descender devices at the continental shelf break (66–120-m depth) to be 0.46 (95\% CI = 0.33–0.65). When a combination of HMMs and prior information was utilized, we estimated survival of the same 40 groupers to be 0.61 (95\% CI = 0.47–0.80). Both estimates represented a substantial improvement over the survival of surface-released groupers (n = 9; survival ~0.0). Furthermore, HMMs estimated zero survival for an additional five descended groupers at a wreck site in 240-m depth, although one analysis using prior information suggested that survival was possible in that depth. These estimates were aided by the objectivity of HMMs, and we recommend that future survival studies involving acoustic tagging employ similar methodologies. The improved survival of groupers after descending is an important finding for management, as this taxon contains several species of impaired stock status or fishery status.},

We tested the alternative hypotheses of time minimization and energy maximization as a response to distance between habitats. We also determined if manatees mitigate foraging constraints with increased visits to closer thermal refuges. We used hidden Markov models to assign discrete behaviors from movement parameters as a function of water temperature and assessed the influence of distance on foraging duration in water temperatures above (\\&gt; 20°C) and below (≤ 20°C) the lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone of manatees. We found that with increased distance, manatees decreased foraging duration in cold water temperature and increased foraging duration in warmer temperatures. We also found that manatees returned to closer thermal refuges more often. Our results suggest that the spatial relationship of thermal and forage habitats can impact behavioral decisions regarding foraging.

These models are often developed using species-specific data to link behaviour and physiology and predict how individuals and populations perform in changing environments. Novel bio-logging technology, applied to free-ranging animals, provide detailed information about individual behavioural variations and responses to the environment. However, so far, no DEB-IBM has attempted to link and parameterise energy dynamics with the fine-scale activity data obtained by bio-logging to answer questions related to life history events in wild populations. The aim of this study is, therefore, to develop and test a DEB-IBM framework which integrates individuals behaviour obtained from high-resolution activity data. Our approach uses data collected with GPS and accelerometer tags attached to two muskox (Ovibos moschatus). The individuals had different fates: one survived the Arctic winter, while the other died. Applying hidden Markov models to accelerometer data, we quantified the variation in behavioural activity budgets (in stationary, feeding and transit) in relation to environmental conditions. We subsequently test how differences in time allocation affect fitness outcomes such as body mass, energy reserves and survival. The proportion of time spent feeding by each animal is used within the DEB-IBM framework to scale the functional response for food acquisition. Simulations using the seasonal feeding budget of the deceased individual lead to drastically reduced energy reserves and body weight during the Arctic winter, and to elevated probabilities of mortality by the end of winter. In contrast, simulations using the seasonal feeding pattern of the surviving muskox, result in much less pronounced losses in reserves and body weight, leading to negligible over-winter mortality. The framework we present here uses standardized modelling techniques, is applicable across species and can easily be extended to include other fitness measures or environmental stressors. Moreover, our framework provides the foundation needed for future studies to link individual movements, energetic processes, life history events and population dynamics in wildlife, which would open up possibilities to test how changing (future) environmental conditions influence animal decision-making and ultimately population level consequences.}

Recent technological advancements in biologging enable us to obtain increasingly detailed information from free-ranging animals, covering longer periods of time, and providing the data needed to assess such impacts. In Sweden, more than 80 000 moose are harvested annually, mostly hunted with the use of baying dogs. The effects of this hunting method on animal welfare and stress are understudied. Here, we evaluated 6 real and 17 experimental hunting approaches with baying dogs [wearing global positioning system (GPS) collars] on 8 adult female moose equipped with ruminal temperature loggers, subcutaneous heart rate (HR) loggers and GPS collars with accelerometers. The obtained data were used to analyse the behavioural and physiological responses of moose to hunting with dogs. Successful experimental approaches (moose and dog were within 240 m for \\&gt;10 min) resulted in higher maximum body temperature (Tb, 0.88°C higher) and a mean increase in HR of 24 bpm in moose at the day of the approach compared to the day after. The moose rested on average \\&gt;90 min longer the day after the approach compared to the day of the approach. The moose travelled on average 4.2 km longer and had a 1.3 m/s higher maximum speed the day of the approach compared to the day after. Our results demonstrate that hunting with dogs increase moose energy expenditure and resting time (and consequently decrease time available for foraging) on an individual level.

A first step towards such parametrization concerns the objective quantification of behavioural states at high resolution. We experimentally exposed individual Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in a net pen to the playback of seismic airgun sounds. We demonstrated that individual cod in the net pen did not change their swimming patterns immediately at the onset of the sound exposure. However, several individuals changed their time spent in three different behavioural states during the 1 h exposure. This may be translated to changes in energy expenditure and provide suitable input for energy budget models that allow predictions about fitness and population consequences.}

abstract = {Abstract Estimates of species abundance are critical to understand population processes and to assess and select management actions. However, capturing and marking individuals for abundance estimation, while providing robust information, can be economically and logistically prohibitive, particularly for species with cryptic behavior. Camera traps can be used to collect data at temporal and spatial scales necessary for estimating abundance, but the use of camera traps comes with limitations when target species are not uniquely identifiable (i.e., “unmarked”). Abundance estimation is particularly useful in the management of invasive species, with herpetofauna being recognized as some of the most pervasive and detrimental invasive vertebrate species. However, the use of camera traps for these taxa presents additional challenges with relevancy across multiple taxa. It is often necessary to use lures to attract animals in order to obtain sufficient observations, yet lure attraction can influence species’ landscape use and potentially induce bias in abundance estimators. We investigated these challenges and assessed the feasibility of obtaining reliable abundance estimates using camera-trapping data on a population of invasive brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis) in Guam. Data were collected using camera traps in an enclosed area where snakes were subject to high-intensity capture–recapture effort, resulting in presumed abundance of 116 snakes (density = 23/ha). We then applied spatial count, random encounter and staying time, space to event, and instantaneous sampling estimators to photo-capture data to estimate abundance and compared estimates to our presumed abundance. We found that all estimators for unmarked populations performed poorly, with inaccurate or imprecise abundance estimates that limit their usefulness for management in this system. We further investigated the sensitivity of these estimators to the use of lures (i.e., violating the assumption that animal behavior is unchanged by sampling) and camera density in a simulation study. Increasing the effective distances of a lure (i.e., lure attraction) and camera density both resulted in biased abundance estimates. Each estimator rarely recovered truth or suffered from convergence issues. Our results indicate that, when limited to unmarked estimators and the use of lures, camera traps alone are unlikely to produce abundance estimates with utility for brown treesnake management.},

Geophysical exploration of the seabed is typically done through seismic surveys, using airgun arrays that produce intense, low-frequency-sound pulses1 that can be heard over hundreds of square kilometers, 24/7.2,3 Little is known about the effects of these sounds on free-ranging fish behavior.4, 5, 6 Effects reported range from subtle individual change in activity and swimming depth for captive fish7,8 to potential avoidance9 and changes in swimming velocity and diurnal activity patterns for free-swimming animals.10 However, the extent and duration of behavioral responses to seismic surveys remain largely unexplored for most fish species.4 In this study, we investigated the effect of a full-scale seismic survey on the movement behavior of free-swimming Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). We found that cod did not leave the detection area more than expected during the experimental survey but that they left more quickly from 2 days to 2 weeks after the survey. Furthermore, during the exposure, cod decreased their activity, with time spent being “locally active” (moving small distances, showing high body acceleration) becoming shorter, and time spent being “inactive” (moving small distances, having low body acceleration) becoming longer. Additionally, diurnal activity cycles were disrupted with lower locally active peaks at dusk and dawn, periods when cod are known to actively feed.11,12 The combined effects of delayed deterrence and activity disruption indicate the potential for seismic surveys to affect energy budgets and to ultimately lead to population-level consequences.13}

Differences in size and environmental characteristics of ontogenetic habitats can lead to differences in movement patterns, behavior, habitat use, and spatial distributions across individuals of the same species. Knowledge of juvenile loggerhead turtles' dispersal, movements, and habitat use is largely unknown, especially in the Mediterranean Sea. Satellite relay data loggers were used to monitor movements, diving behavior, and water temperature of eleven large juvenile loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) deliberately caught in an oceanic habitat in the Mediterranean Sea. Hidden Markov models were used over 4,430 spatial locations to quantify the different activities performed by each individual: transit, low-, and high-intensity diving. Model results were then analyzed in relation to water temperature, bathymetry, and distance to the coast. The hidden Markov model differentiated between bouts of area-restricted search as low- and high-intensity diving, and transit movements. The turtles foraged in deep oceanic waters within 60 km from the coast as well as above 140 km from the coast. They used an average area of 194,802 km2, where most individuals used the deepest part of the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea with the highest seamounts, while only two switched to neritic foraging showing plasticity in foraging strategies among turtles of similar age classes. The foraging distribution of large juvenile loggerhead turtles, including some which were of the minimum size of adults, in the Tyrrhenian Sea is mainly concentrated in a relatively small oceanic area with predictable mesoscale oceanographic features, despite the proximity of suitable neritic foraging habitats.

abstract = {Abstract Hidden Markov models (HMMs) that include individual-level random effects have recently been promoted for inferring animal movement behaviour from biotelemetry data. These ‘mixed HMMs’ come at significant cost in terms of implementation and computation, and discrete random effects have been advocated as a practical alternative to more computationally intensive continuous random effects. However, the performance of mixed HMMs has not yet been sufficiently explored to justify their widespread adoption, and there is currently little guidance for practitioners weighing the costs and benefits of mixed HMMs for a particular research objective. I performed an extensive simulation study comparing the performance of a suite of fixed and random effect models for individual heterogeneity in the hidden state process of a two-state HMM. I focused on sampling scenarios more typical of telemetry studies, which often consist of relatively long time series (30–250 observations per animal) for relatively few individuals (5–100 animals). I generally found mixed HMMs did not improve state assignment relative to standard HMMs. Reliable estimation of random effects required larger sample sizes than are often feasible in telemetry studies. Continuous random effect models performed reasonably well with data generated under discrete random effects, but not vice versa. Random effects accounting for unexplained individual variation can improve estimation of state transition probabilities and measurable covariate effects, but discrete random effects can be a relatively poor (and potentially misleading) approximation for continuous variation. When weighing the costs and benefits of mixed HMMs, three important considerations are study objectives, sample size and model complexity. HMM applications often focus on state assignment with little emphasis on heterogeneity in state transition probabilities, in which case random effects in the hidden state process simply may not be worth the additional effort. However, if explaining variation in state transition probabilities is a primary objective and sufficient explanatory covariates are not available, then random effects are worth pursuing as a more parsimonious alternative to individual fixed effects. To help put my findings in context and illustrate some potential challenges that practitioners may encounter when applying mixed HMMs, I revisit a previous analysis of long-finned pilot whale biotelemetry data.},

ABSTRACT={As a keystone megafaunal species, African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) influence the structure and composition of tropical forests. Determining the links between food resources, environmental conditions and elephant movement behavior is crucial to understanding their habitat requirements and their effects on the ecosystem, particularly in the face of poaching and global change. We investigate whether fruit abundance or climate most strongly influence forest elephant movement behavior at the landscape scale in Gabon. Trained teams of “elephant trackers” performed daily fruit availability and dietary composition surveys over a year within two relatively pristine and intact protected areas. With data from 100 in-depth field follows of 28 satellite-collared elephants and remotely sensed environmental layers, we use linear mixed-effects models to assess the effects of sites, seasons, focal elephant identification, elephant diet, and fruit availability on elephant movement behavior at monthly and 3-day time scales. At the month-level, rainfall, and to a lesser extent fruit availability, most strongly predicted the proportion of time elephants spent in long, directionally persistent movements. Thus, even elephants in moist tropical rainforests show seasonal behavioral phenotypes linked to rainfall. At the follow-level (2–4 day intervals), relative support for both rainfall and fruit availability decreased markedly, suggesting that at finer spatial scales forest elephants make foraging decisions largely based on other factors not directly assessed here. Focal elephant identity explained the majority of the variance in the data, and there was strong support for interindividual variation in behavioral responses to rainfall. Taken together, this highlights the importance of approaches which follow individuals through space and time. The links between climate, resource availability and movement behavior provide important insights into the behavioral ecology of forest elephants that can contribute to understanding their role as seed dispersers, improving management of populations, and informing development of solutions to human-elephant conflict.}

abstract = {Sound is an environmental feature that is used by a variety of marine taxa for feeding, reproduction, navigation and predator avoidance. Consequently, alterations to the soundscape have the potential to alter an individual’s behaviour, physiology and ultimately fitness. Furthermore, such responses have the potential to negatively influence commercial fishing interests. In Atlantic Canada, snow crab fishing and hydrocarbon extraction are billion dollar industries. Snow crab harvesters contend that seismic noise from hydrocarbon exploration has strong negative effects on catch rates; an issue that is likely to become more acute given that the species is currently in decline. As part of a collaborative, multi-disciplinary study conducted offshore on the continental slope, positioning telemetry was used from 2015-2017 in a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study design to assess the behavioral responses of snow crab to exposure from industry seismic vessels. While effects of seismic exposure on snow crab movement could not be ruled out completely, effects were at most quite small relative to natural variation. In contrast, snow crab exhibited much clearer responses to handling, temperature and time of day. Overall, our results suggest that seismic effects, specific to the behavior of adult male snow crab, are at most subtle and are not likely to be a prominent threat to the fishery.}

abstract = {Abstract The foraging movement behaviour of grey wolves (Canis lupus) is unique in summer, when the focus of breeding wolves is on taking care of new-born offspring. In this study, we analysed the movement tracks of nine radio-collared wolves during their pup-rearing season. The wolves lived in the boreal zone in Finland. Our interest was in analysing the foraging trips of wolves from the den site, which serves as the central place of the pack in summer. Based on the information on spatial relocations and time of the day, the movement tracks of the collared wolves were split into segments using hidden Markov models (HMM). Those segments were considered to be produced by different movement behaviour modes that were not observed. We first split the movement tracks of the wolves into separate foraging trips using a two-state HMM and further extracted the different movement modes with a four-state HMM. The modes were interpreted as rest, moderate activity, homing to the den site and fast movement for other purposes, such as leaving the den. Our analysis showed that, for most of the individuals, the movement during homing was fastest and most persistent. This research highlights the foraging behaviour of wolves during the pup-rearing season, which has gained less attention than the nomadic behaviour outside of this season. Our study showed how cyclic foraging trips can be divided into behavioural phases using HMMs, and how these behaviours appear in different times of the day. These results have potential uses, for instance, when studying the habitat requirements and usage or assessing the risk of human–wildlife conflicts.},

abstract = {Current food supply is a major driver of timing of breeding in income-breeding animals, likely because increased net energy balance directly increases reproductive hormones and advances breeding. In capital breeders, increased net energy balance increases energy reserves, which eventually leads to improved reproductive readiness and earlier breeding. To test the hypothesis that phenology of income-breeding birds is independent of energy reserves, we conducted an experiment on food-supplemented (“fed”) and control female black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). We temporarily increased energy costs (via weight handicap) in a 2 × 2 design (fed/unfed; handicapped/unhandicapped) during the pre-laying period and observed movement via GPS-accelerometry. We measured body mass, baseline hormones (corticosterone; luteinising hormone) before and after handicap manipulation, and conducted a gonadotropin-releasing hormone challenge. Females from all treatment groups foraged in similar areas, implying that individuals could adjust time spent foraging, but had low flexibility to adjust foraging distance. Consistent with the idea that income breeders do not accumulate reserves in response to increased food supply, fed birds remained within an energy ceiling by reducing time foraging instead of increasing energy reserves. Moreover, body mass remained constant until the onset of follicle development 20 days prior to laying regardless of feeding or handicap, implying that females were using a ‘lean and fit’ approach to body mass rather than accumulating lipid reserves for breeding. Increased food supply advanced endocrine and laying phenology and altered interactions between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, but higher energy costs (handicap) had little effect. Consistent with our hypothesis, increased food supply (but not net energy balance) advanced endocrine and laying phenology in income-breeding birds without any impact on energy reserves.}

ABSTRACT={Many marine mammals rely on sound for foraging, maintaining group cohesion, navigation, finding mates, and avoiding predators. These behaviors are potentially disrupted by anthropogenic noise. Behavioral responses to sonar have been observed in a number of baleen whale species but relatively little is known about the responses of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). Previous analyses demonstrated a spatial redistribution of localizations derived from passive acoustic detections in response to sonar activity, but the lack of a mechanism for associating localizations prevented discriminating between movement and cessation of calling as possible explanations for this redistribution. Here we extend previous analyses by including an association mechanism, allowing us to differentiate between movement responses and calling responses, and to provide direct evidence of horizontal avoidance responses by individual minke whales to sonar during U.S. Navy training activities. We fitted hidden Markov models to 627 tracks that were reconstructed from 3 years of minke whale (B. acutorostrata) vocalizations recorded before, during, and after naval training events at the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Missile Range Facility, Kauai, Hawaii. The fitted models were used to identify different movement behaviors and to investigate the effect of sonar activity on these behaviors. Movement was faster and more directed during sonar exposure than in baseline phases. The mean direction of movement differed during sonar exposure, and was consistent with movement away from sonar-producing ships. Animals were also more likely to cease calling during sonar. There was substantial individual variation in response. Our findings add large-sample support to previous demonstrations of horizontal avoidance responses by individual minke whales to sonar in controlled exposure experiments, and demonstrate the complex nature of behavioral responses to sonar activity: some, but not all, whales exhibited behavioral changes, which took the form of horizontal avoidance or ceasing to call.}

abstract = {Abstract To conserve wide-ranging species in human-modified landscapes, it is essential to understand how animals selectively use or avoid cultivated areas. Use of agriculture leads to human–wildlife conflict, but evidence suggests that individuals may differ in their tendency to be involved in conflict. This is particularly relevant to wild elephant populations. We analysed GPS data of 66 free-ranging elephants in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem to quantify their use of agriculture. We then examined factors influencing the level of agricultural use, individual change in use across years and differences in activity budgets associated with use. Using clustering methods, our data grouped into four agricultural use tactics: rare (<0.6\% time in agriculture; 26\% of population), sporadic (0.6\%–3.8\%; 34\%), seasonal (3.9\%–12.8\%; 31\%) and habitual (>12.8\%; 9\%). Sporadic and seasonal individuals represented two-thirds (67\%) of recorded GPS fixes in agriculture, compared to 32\% from habitual individuals. Increased agricultural use was associated with higher daily distance travelled and larger home range size, but not with age or sex. Individual tactic change was prevalent and the habitual tactic was maintained in consecutive years by only five elephants. Across tactics, individuals switched from diurnal to nocturnal activity during agricultural use, interpreted as representing similar risk perception of cultivated areas. Conversely, tactic choice appeared to be associated with differences in risk tolerance between individuals. Together, our results suggest that elephants are balancing the costs and benefits of crop usage at both fine (e.g. crop raid events) and long (e.g. yearly tactic change) temporal scales. The high proportion of sporadic and seasonal tactics also highlights the importance of mitigation strategies that address conflict arising from many animals, rather than targeted management of habitual crop raiders. Our approach can be applied to other species and systems to characterize individual variation in human resource use and inform mitigations for human–wildlife coexistence.},

ABSTRACT={Sex differences in diet and foraging behaviour are common in sexually dimorphic species, often driven by differences in the cost of locomotion or ability to exploit different ecological niches. However, sex-specific foraging strategies also occur in monomorphic or slightly dimorphic species where the drivers are poorly understood. Here, we study sex differences in foraging of northern gannets (Morus bassanus), where females are only slightly heavier than males. Using concurrently tracked gannets (298 full foraging trips from 81 individuals) and fishing vessels across 5 years, we quantify individual-based vessel-associated putative foraging, and relate this to discard consumption. We found a significant positive relationship between time spent in vessel-associated foraging and discard consumption for both sexes. However, while females showed greater proportions of vessel-associated foraging than males, discarded fish contributed less to the diet of females in all years. These results contrast with previous suggestions that female gannets interact with vessels less often than males, and are consistent with competitive exclusion of females from trawler-associated discards. Our findings give insight into sexual differences in foraging behaviour in the absence of dimorphism that are necessary to predict their response to environmental and anthropogenic changes.}

abstract = {Arctic species encounter multiple stressors including climate change and environmental contaminants. Some contaminants may disrupt hormones that govern the behavioural responses of wildlife to climatic variation, and thus the capacity of species to respond to climate change. We investigated correlative interactions between legacy and emerging persistent organic pollutants (POPs), mercury (Hg), hormones and behaviours, in thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) (N = 163) breeding in northern Hudson Bay (2016–2018). The blood profile of the murres was dominated by methylmercury (MeHg), followed by much lower levels of sum (∑) 35 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethylene (DDE), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) BDE-47, -99 and BDE-100; all other measured organochlorine pesticides and replacement brominated flame retardants had low concentrations if detected. Inter-annual variations occurred in MeHg, circulating triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and the foraging behaviours of the murres, identified using GPS-accelerometers. Compared to the 50-year mean date (1971–2021) for 50% of sea-ice coverage in Hudson Bay, sea-ice breakup was 1–2 weeks earlier (2016, 2017) or comparable (2018). Indeed, 2017 was the earliest year on record. Consistent with relationships identified individually between MeHg and total T3, and T3 and foraging behaviour, a direct interaction between these three parameters was evident when all possible interactions among measured chemical pollutants, hormones, and behaviours of the murres were considered collectively (path analysis). When murres were likely already stressed due to early sea-ice breakup (2016, 2017), blood MeHg influenced circulating T3 that in turn reduced foraging time underwater. We conclude that when sea-ice breaks up early in the breeding season, Hg may interfere with the ability of murres to adjust their foraging behaviour via T3 in relation to variation in sea-ice.}

ABSTRACT={The ability to locate essential resources is a critical step for wildlife translocated into novel environments. Understanding this process of exploration is highly desirable for management that seeks to resettle wildlife, particularly as translocation projects tend to be expensive and have a high potential for failure. African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) are very mobile and rely on large areas especially in arid environments, and are translocated for differing management and conservation objectives. Thus, research into how translocated elephants use the landscape when released may both guide elephant managers and be useful for translocations of other species that adjust their movement to social and ecological conditions. In this study, we investigated the movement of eight GPS tracked calves (translocated in three cohorts) following their soft release into a 107 km<sup>2</sup> fenced wildlife sanctuary in northern Kenya and compared their movement with that of five tracked wild elephants in the sanctuary. We describe their exploration of the sanctuary, discovery of water points, and activity budgets during the first seven, 14, and 20 months after release. We explored how patterns are affected by time since release, ecological conditions, and social factors. We found that calves visited new areas of the sanctuary and water points during greener periods and earlier post-release. Social context was associated with exploration, with later release and association with wild elephants predictive of visits to new areas. Wild elephants tended to use a greater number of sites per 14-day period than the released calves. Activity budgets determined from hidden Markov models (including the states directed walk, encamped, and meandering) suggested that released calves differed from wild elephants. The first two cohorts of calves spent a significantly greater proportion of time in the directed walk state and a significantly lower proportion of time in the encamped state relative to the wild elephants. Our results represent a step forward in describing the movements of elephant orphan calves released to the wild following a period of profound social disruption when they lost their natal family and were rehabilitated with other orphan calves under human care. We discuss the implications of the elephant behavior we observed for improving release procedures and for defining success benchmarks for translocation projects.}

abstract = {Plantation forests are increasing worldwide and generally have lower biodiversity value than surrounding native vegetation. However, when established on previously cleared land, they can provide important habitat for some wildlife species and have positive conservation outcomes. In southern Australia, the establishment of southern blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) plantations on cleared land has expanded the area of koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) habitat; however, koalas are at risk of injury, death and displacement when plantations are harvested. Consequently, an understanding of the response of koalas to harvesting is vital for developing management strategies that allow for plantation harvest while also improving welfare outcomes for koalas. We used GPS tracking and a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design to investigate the impact of blue gum plantation harvest on koala survival, body mass, reproduction, and movements. A total of 44 koalas (17 males, 27 females) from two plantations (one harvested, one unharvested) were monitored for 8 months encompassing before (5 weeks), during (11.5 weeks) and after (15.5 weeks) harvest. Survival was high with only two koalas (harvested plantation) dying of unknown causes but neither considered to be a direct result of harvesting. Harvesting did not have any detectable impact on body mass and pouch young production and only a minor effect on the amount of time koalas spent moving. By the end of the study period, 79% of the koalas originally living in the harvested plantation had moved to the surrounding plantations, while the remainder stayed within the harvested area in unharvested trees. In the unharvested plantation, 18% moved out and 82% remained. We attribute the high survival during harvest to active searching by koala ‘spotters’ ahead of harvesting machinery and subsequent retention of each koala’s tree and the surrounding eight trees. We suggest that the proximity of the harvested plantation to adjacent plantations facilitated safe dispersal of koalas out of the plantation, increasing the probability of survival and reducing the energy and movement distances. Our findings suggest that the plantation harvesting can result in minimal impact on resident koalas but that the influence of landscape context around harvested plantations should be the subject of future research.}

abstract = {Abstract Group living in species can have complex consequences for individuals, populations, and ecosystems. Therefore, estimating group density and size is often essential for understanding population dynamics, interspecific interactions, and conservation needs of group-living species. Spatial capture–recapture (SCR) has been used to model both individual and group density in group-living species, but modeling either individual-level or group-level detection results in different biases due to common characteristics of group-living species, such as highly cohesive movement or variation in group size. Furthermore, no SCR method currently estimates group density, individual density, and group size jointly. Using clustered point processes, we developed a cluster SCR model to estimate group density, individual density, and group size. We compared the model to standard SCR models using both a simulation study and a data set of detections of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), a group-living carnivore, on camera traps in northern Botswana. We then tested the model's performance under various scenarios of group movement in a separate simulation study. We found that the cluster SCR model outperformed a standard group-level SCR model when fitted to data generated with varying group sizes, and mostly recovered previous estimates of wild dog group density, individual density, and group size. We also found that the cluster SCR model performs better as individuals' movements become more correlated with their groups' movements. The cluster SCR model offers opportunities to investigate ecological hypotheses relating group size to population dynamics while accounting for cohesive movement behaviors in group-living species.},

abstract = {Abstract Bio-logging technology is now the golden standard for assessing how individual animals change their movement and behavior over time and space. Three-dimensional accelerometer data, in particular, can provide extremely detailed information on individuals' activity and energetics associated with critical life-history events, such as reproduction and mortality. Applications, where accelerometer data have been recorded over sufficiently long periods of time to quantify how individuals modulate their activities when facing seasonality, environmental constraints, and how this might affect life-history events, remain rare, however. We collected high-resolution accelerometer data, over an entire year, from seven muskox females (Ovibos moschatus) with different reproductive statuses moving in the high-Artic. Individual-specific hidden Markov models (HMMs) were built based on overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) and pitch. Snow depth was included as a dependent structure to incorporate the dominant environmental constraint on muskox activity. We used GPS and vaginal implant transmitter data to further clarify the behavioral partition and to validate calving and mortality events. We detected lower ODBA recordings during periods with increased snow depth, suggesting that snow influences animal velocity and movement-related (energetic) costs. Time budgets and behavioral switching showed clear seasonal patterns, with distinct signatures depending on individuals' survival and reproductive status. Individuals that ultimately died drastically reduced time spent foraging/searching for food during winter, between February and May when snow depth is highest, while increasing time spent transiting/being highly active. This pattern could indicate failure to acquire sufficient food resources. Overall, individuals that survived the Arctic year spent greater amounts of time foraging yet with high individual variability in time spent foraging and transiting. Individuals that gave birth showed marked behavioral shifts at parturition times with a clear reduction in foraging behavior and increased activity. We show how long-term high-resolution accelerometer data analyzed within HMM frameworks can successfully be used to detect environmental-dependent behavioral changes with implications for life-history events. Such information opens up opportunities to study life-history events in more detail and will facilitate integration of data at both individual and population levels, which is critical for management and conservation of species.},

abstract = {Abstract Movement is the primary means by which animals obtain resources and avoid hazards. Most movement exhibits directional bias that is related to environmental features (defined as taxis when biased orientation is voluntary), such as the location of food patches, predators, ocean currents or wind. Numerous behaviours with directional bias can be characterised by maintaining orientation at an angle relative to the environmental stimuli (menotaxis), including navigation relative to sunlight or magnetic fields and energy-conserving flight across wind. However, new methods are needed to flexibly classify and characterise such directional bias. We propose a biased correlated random walk model that can identify menotactic behaviours by predicting turning angle as a trade-off between directional persistence and directional bias relative to environmental stimuli without making a priori assumptions about the angle of bias. We apply the model within the framework of a multi-state hidden Markov model (HMM) and describe methods to remedy information loss associated with coarse environmental data to improve the classification and parameterisation of directional bias. Using simulation studies, we illustrate how our method more accurately classifies behavioural states compared to conventional correlated random walk HMMs that do not incorporate directional bias. We illustrate the application of these methods by identifying cross wind olfactory foraging and drifting behaviour mediated by wind-driven sea ice drift in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from movement data collected by satellite telemetry. The extensions we propose can be readily applied to movement data to identify and characterise behaviours with directional bias towards any angle, and open up new avenues to investigate more mechanistic relationships between animal movement and the environment.},

abstract = {Abstract Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and their extensions are attractive methods for analysing ecological data where noisy, multivariate measurements are made of a hidden, ecological process, and where this hidden process is represented by a sequence of discrete states. Yet, as these models become more complex and challenging to understand, it is important to consider what pitfalls these methods have and what opportunities there are for future research to address these pitfalls. In this paper, we review five lesser known pitfalls one can encounter when using HMMs or their extensions to solve ecological problems: (a) violation of the snapshot property in continuous-time HMMs; (b) biased inference from hierarchical HMMs when applied to temporally misaligned processes; (c) sensitive inference from using random effects to partially pool across heterogeneous individuals; (d) computational burden when using HMMs to approximate models with continuous state spaces; and (e) difficulty linking the hidden process to space or environment. This review is for ecologists and ecological statisticians familiar with HMMs, but who may be less aware of the problems that arise in more specialised applications. We demonstrate how each pitfall arises, by simulation or example, and discuss why this pitfall is important to consider. Along with identifying the problems, we highlight potential research opportunities and offer ideas that may help alleviate these pitfalls. Each of the methods we review are solutions to current ecological research problems. We intend for this paper to heighten awareness of the pitfalls ecologists may encounter when applying these more advanced methods, but we also hope that by highlighting future research opportunities, we can inspire ecological statisticians to weaken these pitfalls and provide improved methods.}

ABSTRACT={Multisensor biologging provides a powerful tool for ecological research, enabling fine-scale observation of animals to directly link physiology and movement to behavior across ecological contexts. However, applied research into behavioral disturbance and recovery following human interventions (e.g., capture and translocation) has mostly relied on coarse location-based tracking or unidimensional approaches (e.g., dive profiles and activity/energetic metrics) that may not resolve behaviors and recovery processes. Biologging can improve insights into both disturbed and natural behavior, which is critical for management and conservation initiatives, although challenges remain in objectively identifying distinct behavioral modes from complex multisensor datasets. Using white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) released from a non-lethal catch-and-release shark bite mitigation program, we explored how combining multisensor biologging (video, depth, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers), track reconstruction and behavioral state modeling using hidden Markov models (HMMs) can improve our understanding of behavioral processes and recovery. Biologging tags were deployed on eight white sharks, recording their continuous behaviors, movements, and environmental context (habitat, interactions with other organisms/objects) for periods of 10–87 h post-release. Dive profiles and tailbeat analysis (as a standard, activity-based method for assessing recovery) indicated an immediate “disturbed” period of offshore movement, displaying rapid tailbeats and an average tailbeat-derived recovery period of 9.7 h, with evidence of smaller individuals having longer recoveries. However, further integrating magnetometer-derived headings, track reconstruction and HMM modeling revealed a cryptic shift to diurnal clockwise-counterclockwise circling behavior, which we argue represents compelling new evidence for hypothesized unihemispheric sleep amongst elasmobranchs. By simultaneously providing critical information toward conservation-focused shark management and understudied aspects of shark behavior, our study highlights how integrating multisensor information through HMMs can improve our understanding of both post-release and natural behavior, especially in species that are difficult to observe directly.}

ABSTRACT={Male fin whales sing using 20 Hz pulses produced in regular patterns of inter-note intervals, but little is known about fin whale swimming behavior while they are singing. Even less is known about fin whales in Hawaiian waters because they have rarely been sighted during surveys and passive acoustic monitoring has been limited to sparse hydrophone systems that do not have localization capabilities. We hypothesized that fin whale kinematics may be related to their singing behavior, or external variables such as time and sea state. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed 115 tracks containing 50,034 unique notes generated from passive acoustic recordings on an array of 14 hydrophones from 2011 to 2017 at the U.S. Navy Pacific Missile Range Facility off Kauai, Hawaii. Fin whales swam at an average speed of 1.1 m/s over relatively direct paths. We incorporated the whales' speed and turning angle into hidden Markov models to identify different behavioral states based on the whales' movements. We found that fin whale kinematic behavioral state was related to the vocalization rate (also known as cue rate) and time of day. When cue rate was higher, fin whales were more likely to swim slower and turn more than when cue rate was lower. During the night, fin whales were also more likely to swim slower and turn more than during the day. In addition, we examined whether the presence of singing fin whales was related to time and sea state using generalized additive models. Fin whale track presence was affected by day of the year and song season, and possibly also wind speed and wave height. Although the track kinematics from the fin whale tracks presented here are limited to a subset of whales that are acoustically active, they provide some of the only detailed movements of fin whales in the region and can be compared against fin whale swim speeds in other regions. Understanding how fin whale swimming behavior varies based on their vocalization patterns, time, and environmental factors will help us to contextualize potential changes in whale behavior during Navy training and testing on the range.}

abstract = {Abstract Post-release monitoring of translocated animals is often used to inform future translocation protocols. Quantifying habitat selection of translocated individuals may help identify features that characterize good settlement habitat and thus inform the choice of future release sites. However, translocated animals often undergo post-release behavioural modification, and their habitat selection may vary depending on the underlying behavioural state. To investigate this, we analysed behavioural state-dependent habitat selection in female greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus translocated from Wyoming to North Dakota, USA, using Hidden Markov Models combined with Integrated Step Selection Analysis. We segmented individual trajectories into behavioural phases corresponding to an exploratory state, characterized by broad and directed movements, and a restricted state, characterized by short and tortuous movements. Then, we quantified habitat selection in each state while accounting for seasonality and individual reproductive status. While in the exploratory state, sage-grouse exhibited natal habitat preference induction by selecting for high sagebrush cover, which is typical of their natal area in Wyoming but not of the release area in North Dakota. In the restricted state, sage-grouse selected for gentle topography and also adjusted their habitat selection to constraints imposed by seasonality and reproductive needs by selecting for high herbaceous cover during brood rearing. Synthesis and applications. Habitat selection of translocated sage-grouse differed between the post-release exploration and the settlement phase. Features selected after settling, not during exploration, are likely indicative of suitable settlement habitat. Our results suggest that areas characterized by gentle topography and high herbaceous cover are well-suited as release sites for sage-grouse translocated during the summer, especially brood-rearing females, and that sagebrush cover may not be a critical factor in determining the appropriateness of release sites for sage-grouse in North Dakota. Our findings highlight the need to consider behaviour when using habitat selection estimates to inform the choice of future release sites.},

	abstract = {Many animals learn to relocate important places and reflect this spatial knowledge in their behaviour. Traditionally evidence for learning is examined experimentally by studying spatial memory. However, tools developed for analysing tracking data from widely ranging animals allow a more holistic analysis of behaviour. Here we use the two together in novel combination of experimental and modelling approaches to analyse how patterns of hummingbird movements change as birds learn to find a reward in a location indicated by a pair of landmarks. Using hidden Markov models (HMMs) we identified two movement states which we interpret as Search and Travel and compared these to experimental behavioural measures of spatial memory. When birds had a single training trial to learn a flower{\textquoteright}s location, both the behavioural measures and HMMs showed that hummingbirds relied on landmarks to guide search. Hummingbirds focussed hovering around the rewarded location and were more likely to be in the Search state, and more likely to switch from Travel to Search, when closer to the rewarded location, but only when the landmarks were present. When birds had had 12 additional training trials, however, the HMMs and behavioural measures showed differences in how reliant birds were on landmarks. While behaviours like hovering were still strongly affected by removing landmarks, the likelihood of being in or entered the Search state was the same regardless of whether the landmarks were present or removed. These results suggests that hummingbirds rapidly learn to use nearby landmarks to structure where they search, but as birds gain experience the role of these landmarks changes. While familiar local landmarks were still essential for precise search, experienced birds were able to use alternative cues to guide broad-scale transitions between behaviour. HMMs and traditional behavioural measures each capture a different aspect of this learning, with neither approach alone accurately described the role of landmarks in spatial learning.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Abstract Understanding animal movement often relies upon telemetry and biologging devices. These data are frequently used to estimate latent behavioural states to help understand why animals move across the landscape. While there are a variety of methods that make behavioural inferences from biotelemetry data, some features of these methods (e.g. analysis of a single data stream, use of parametric distributions) may limit their generality to reliably discriminate among behavioural states. To address some of the limitations of existing behavioural state estimation models, we introduce a nonparametric Bayesian framework called the mixed-membership method for movement (M4), which is available within the open-source bayesmove R package. This framework can analyse multiple data streams (e.g. step length, turning angle, acceleration) without relying on parametric distributions, which may capture complex behaviours more successfully than current methods. We tested our Bayesian framework using simulated trajectories and compared model performance against two segmentation methods (behavioural change point analysis (BCPA) and segclust2d), one machine learning method [expectation-maximization binary clustering (EMbC)] and one type of state-space model [hidden Markov model (HMM)]. We also illustrated this Bayesian framework using movements of juvenile snail kites Rostrhamus sociabilis in Florida, USA. The Bayesian framework estimated breakpoints more accurately than the other segmentation methods for tracks of different lengths. Likewise, the Bayesian framework provided more accurate estimates of behaviour than the other state estimation methods when simulations were generated from less frequently considered distributions (e.g. truncated normal, beta, uniform). Three behavioural states were estimated from snail kite movements, which were labelled as ‘encamped’, ‘area-restricted search’ and ‘transit’. Changes in these behaviours over time were associated with known dispersal events from the nest site, as well as movements to and from possible breeding locations. Our nonparametric Bayesian framework estimated behavioural states with comparable or superior accuracy compared to the other methods when step lengths and turning angles of simulations were generated from less frequently considered distributions. Since the most appropriate parametric distributions may not be obvious a priori, methods (such as M4) that are agnostic to the underlying distributions can provide powerful alternatives to address questions in movement ecology.},

It is also, through the position of top predator that these species often occupy, a relevant and integrative indicator of the dynamics of the marine ecosystems they rely on. Seabird trajectories are recorded through the deployment of GPS, and a variety of statistical approaches have been tested to infer probable behaviours from these location data. Recently, deep learning tools have shown promising results for the segmentation and classification of animal behaviour from trajectory data. Yet, these approaches have not been widely used and investigation is still needed to identify optimal network architecture and to demonstrate their generalization properties. From a database of about 300 foraging trajectories derived from GPS data deployed simultaneously with pressure sensors for the identification of dives, this work has benchmarked deep neural network architectures trained in a supervised manner for the prediction of dives from trajectory data. It first confirms that deep learning allows better dive prediction than usual methods such as Hidden Markov Models. It also demonstrates the generalization properties of the trained networks for inferring dives distribution for seabirds from other colonies and ecosystems. In particular, convolutional networks trained on Peruvian boobies from a specific colony show great ability to predict dives of boobies from other colonies and from distinct ecosystems. We further investigate accross-species generalization using a transfer learning strategy known as ‘fine-tuning’. Starting from a convolutional network pre-trained on Guanay cormorant data reduced by two the size of the dataset needed to accurately predict dives in a tropical booby from Brazil. We believe that the networks trained in this study will provide relevant starting point for future fine-tuning works for seabird trajectory segmentation.},

abstract = {Abstract Miniature electronic devices have recently enabled ecologists to document relatively large amounts of animal trajectories. Modelling such trajectories may contribute to explaining the mechanisms underlying observed behaviours and to clarifying ecological processes at the scale of the population by simulating multiple trajectories. Existing approaches to animal movement modelling have mainly addressed the first objective, and are often limited when used for simulation purposes. Individual-based models generally rely on ad hoc formulation and their empirical parametrization lacks generability, while random walks based on mathematically sound statistical inference typically consist of first-order Markovian models calibrated at the local scale which may lead to overly simplistic description and simulation of animal trajectories. We investigate a recent deep learning tool—generative adversarial networks (GAN)—to simulate animal trajectories. GANs consist of a pair of deep neural networks that aim to capture the data distribution of some experimental dataset. They enable the generation of new instances of data that share statistical properties. This study aims at identifying relevant deep network architectures to simulate central-place foraging trajectories, as well as at evaluating GANs drawbacks and benefits over classical methods, such as state-switching hidden Markov models (HMM). We demonstrate the outstanding ability of deep convolutional GANs to simulate and to capture medium- to large-scale properties of seabird foraging trajectories. GAN-derived synthetic trajectories reproduced the Fourier spectral density of observed trajectories better than those simulated using HMMs. However, unlike HMMs, GANs do not adequately capture local-scale descriptive statistics, such as step speed distributions. GANs provide a new likelihood-free approach to calibrate complex stochastic processes and thus open new research avenues for animal movement modelling. We discuss the potential uses of GANs in movement ecology and future developments to better capture local-scale features. In this context, embedding HMM-based priors in GAN schemes appears as a promising research direction.},

abstract = {Abstract Spatio-temporal maps of organismal density or relative abundance are fundamental to many applications in conservation and ecology. There are often a number of data sources to inform species maps, including citizen science monitoring programs, remote sensing, geolocation data from satellite-tagged animals and formal scientific surveys. In these cases, it may be desirable to come up with a single map integrating all data sources. We introduce a novel two-step method for combining inference about relative abundance maps using multiple data sources. Log-scale relative abundance surfaces are first estimated from individual data sets, and resultant surfaces are then treated as ‘data’ within a generalized linear mixed model framework with a spatially autocorrelated mean process. We also introduce generalizations allowing data misalignment and predictive processes to decrease computational burden. Using simulation, we show that our approach frequently outperfoms other approaches, including basing inference on a single surface, or taking a simple arithmetic mean (although the arithmetic mean performs well when there are few surfaces). We then demonstrate our method using citizen science and satellite-tracking data of Steller sea lions in Alaska. In this case, relative abundance surfaces consisted of an effort-adjusted map developed from platform-of-opportunity sightings and a utilization distribution developed from geolocation records. The resulting combined surface represented a compromise between single-data source predictions. Our approach should be useful for ecologists seeking to reconcile alternative species distribution maps, particularly when individual surfaces are prone to bias, when there is no obvious common currency (e.g. point process), or when computational demands preclude a fully integrated analysis.},

abstract = {Abstract For wide-ranging species in temperate environments, populations at high-latitude range limits are subject to more extreme conditions, colder temperatures, and greater snow accumulation compared to their core range. As climate change progresses, these bounding pressures may become more moderate on average, while extreme weather occurs more frequently. Individuals can mitigate temporarily extreme conditions by changing daily activity budgets and exhibiting plasticity in resource selection, both of which facilitate existence at and expansion of high-latitude range boundaries. However, relatively little work has explored how animals moderate movement and vary resource selection with changing weather, and a general framework for such investigations is lacking. We applied hidden Markov models and step selection functions to GPS data from wintering wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) near their northern range limit to identify how weather influenced transition among discrete movement states, as well as state-specific resource selection. We found that turkeys were more likely to spend time in a stationary state as wind chill temperatures decreased and snow depth increased. Both stationary and roosting turkeys selected conifer forests and avoided land covers associated with foraging, such as agriculture and residential areas, while shifting their strength of selection for these features during poor weather. In contrast, mobile turkeys showed relatively weak resource selection, with less response in selection coefficients during poor weather. Our findings illustrate that behavioral plasticity in response to weather was context-dependent, but movement behaviors most associated with poor weather were also those in which resource selection was most plastic. Given our results, the potential for wild turkey range expansion will partly be determined by availability of habitat that allows them to withstand periodic inclement weather. Combining hidden Markov models with step selection functions is broadly applicable for evaluating plasticity in animal behavior and dynamic resource selection in response to changing weather. We studied turkeys at northern range limits, but this approach is applicable for any system expected to experience significant changes in the coming decade, and may be particularly relevant to populations existing at range peripheries.},

For birds, rainfall may affect behavior, impairing senses and increasing energetic costs, but its consequences on movement patterns are poorly explored. We investigated the influence of rainfall on the foraging behavior of the magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens. This peculiar tropical seabird lacks feather waterproofing and is known to track environmental conditions while searching for food. Thus, its foraging behavior should be highly sensitive to the effects of rainfall. By GPS-tracking chick-rearing adults, we showed that frigatebirds did not avoid areas with rainfall during foraging trips, nor did rainfall influence trip characteristics. However, rainfall decreased time devoted to foraging and increased time spent perching. Moreover, it affected flight mode, inducing birds to fly slower and at lower altitudes. Wind speed, which was not correlated with rainfall, only affected behavior during night-time, with strong winds decreasing time spent perching. Our results indicate that rainfall does not affect the spatial distribution of foraging frigatebirds but does alter fine-scale foraging behavior by reducing flight activity. We suggest that the ongoing environmental change in this region, including an increase in rainfall events, has the potential to impair foraging and negatively affect fitness.}",

ABSTRACT={North Pacific minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) boing calls are commonly detected in Hawaiian waters. When producing boing vocalizations, minke whales seem to be in one of two calling behavioral states. Most often minke whales produce boings with inter-call intervals of several minutes, but sometimes minke whales call rapidly with inter-call intervals of less than a minute. Since minke whales are difficult to detect visually, cue-rate-based density estimation using passive acoustic monitoring has been proposed. However, the variables that influence cue rate or calling rate are poorly understood in most whales, including minke whales. We collected passive acoustic recordings from 47 bottom-mounted hydrophones at the Pacific Missile Range Facility’s instrumented range off the coast of Kauaʻi, Hawaiʻi to test the hypothesis that minke whales call more rapidly when closer in proximity to other calling conspecifics. A total of 599 days of data were recorded between August 2012 and July 2017 and were automatically post-processed to detect, classify, and localize calls. Localized calls were grouped into tracks and manually validated, resulting in 509 individual tracks composed of 36,033 calls within a 16 x 39 km focal study area. Tracked minke whales exhibited a strong bimodal call rate with means of one call every 6.85 min (σ= 2.54 min) and 0.63 min (σ= 0.36 min). We ran hidden Markov models to quantify the relationship between call rate and the distance to the nearest calling conspecific. Overall, the probability of the higher call rate occurring increased as the distance to the nearest conspecific decreased, and the probability of the lower call rate occurring increased as the distance to the nearest conspecific increased. We also examined individual track data and found that minke whales may also exhibit other responses (i.e. increased speed, changes in heading, and cessation of calling) when calling conspecifics are nearby. These findings provide new information about minke whale calling behavior in what is likely a breeding area.}

    abstract = "{Breeding is costly for many animals, including birds that must deliver food to a central place (i.e. nest). Measuring energy expenditure throughout the breeding season can provide valuable insight into physiological limitations by highlighting periods of high demand, and ultimately allows improvement of conservation strategies. However, quantifying energy expenditure in wildlife can be challenging, as existing methods do not measure both active (e.g. foraging) and resting energy costs across short and long time scales. Here, we developed a novel method for comparing active and resting costs in 66 pre-breeding and breeding seabirds (black-legged kittiwakes, Rissa tridactyla) by combining accelerometry and triiodothyronine (T3) as proxies for active and resting costs, respectively. Active energy costs were higher during incubation (P=0.0004) and chick rearing (P\\&lt;0.0001) than during pre-laying, because of an increase in the time spent in flight of 11\\% (P=0.0005) and 15\\% (P\\&lt;0.0001), respectively. Levels of T3, reflecting resting costs, peaked marginally during incubation with a mean (±s.d.) concentration of 4.71±1.97 pg ml−1 in comparison to 2.66±1.30 pg ml−1 during pre-laying (P=0.05) and 3.16±2.85 pg ml−1 during chick rearing (P=0.11). Thus, although chick rearing is often assumed to be the costliest breeding stage by multiple studies, our results suggest that incubation could be more costly as a result of high resting costs. We highlight the importance of accounting for both active and resting costs when assessing energy expenditure.}",

ABSTRACT={Understanding how marine predators find patchily distributed prey resources in a dynamic environment is key to identifying important ecological areas for ecosystem-level conservation management. However, the mechanisms underpinning important foraging areas often result from complex interactions between static and dynamic covariates (e.g. topography and currents). Modelling habitat associations with hydrodynamic processes is rarely useful when attempting to identify and characterise foraging areas across an individual’s foraging range. Investigating the influence of static habitat features on predator behaviour can provide a more tractable baseline understanding of habitat associations, upon which additional complexity can be added. Seabed gradient covariates (e.g. slope and aspect) are often used, yet such metrics are computed at singular user-defined resolutions, and provide limited ecological insight when used in isolation. Instead, categorising the seabed into geomorphological features may provide better characterisation of seabed structure. Here we explore the utility of a pattern recognition algorithm to delineate whole geomorphological features (“geomorphons”) on the seabed (e.g. valleys, ridges, footslopes) from bathymetry data, and examine the influence of geomorphology on marine predator habitat use. We demonstrate the potential application of this approach in a case study, examining the influence of geomorphons on the at-sea behaviour of a highly mobile predator inhabiting shelf seas: the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). We analyse GPS tracking data from three seals tagged in the southern North Sea, an area with heterogeneous geomorphology. We use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to infer foraging and travelling behaviour and model the effect of different feature types on the probability of switching between states. All three seals showed an increased probability of transitioning from travelling to foraging when encountering slopes, footslopes and hollows, and foraging activity was concentrated at slopes on the fringes of the Dogger Bank. We hypothesise that such features may host prey aggregations, and/or lead to increased prey capture success. The results suggest the importance of such areas for grey seals in the southern North Sea, a region undergoing rapid and widespread anthropogenic habitat change. This method could be incorporated into future species distribution models to improve estimates of predator distribution, informing conservation management and marine spatial planning.}

ABSTRACT={Gadfly petrels (genus Pterodroma) are one of the most threatened groups of birds. They are exceptionally well adapted to forage over enormous areas to maximize chances of encountering prey. Their wide-ranging travel, extensive use of oceanic habitats beyond national jurisdictions (the high seas), and limited information on their at-sea distributions and foraging ecology pose several management challenges. Here, we examined the foraging distributions and habitat preferences of three gadfly petrels that breed on Phillip Island (Norfolk Island Group), in the southwest Pacific Ocean, and tested the ability of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict important marine habitats. GPS loggers were deployed in 2018 and 2019 on chick-provisioning black-winged petrels (P. nigripennis) and white-necked petrels (P. cervicalis) and in 2020 on Kermadec petrels (P. neglecta), and hidden Markov models (HMMs) were used to estimate behavioral states across 387 foraging trips. SDMs were built using six algorithms and the predictive performance of models constructed using conventional random cross-validation (CV) was compared to those constructed with spatially independent CV. All three species demonstrated dual-foraging strategies with short trips closer to the colony and longer, presumably self-provisioning, trips with maximum distances from the colony of several thousand kilometers for black-winged and white-necked petrels. Foraging areas of each species were distinctly partitioned across the Tasman Sea during long trips, but there was high overlap during short trips. Black-winged and white-necked petrels exhibited area-restricted search foraging behavior throughout their foraging ranges which spanned almost the entire Tasman Sea and into the western Pacific, whereas the foraging range of Kermadec petrels was restricted closer to the colony. Approximately half of each species’ foraging range extended into the high seas. Response curves and variable importance between the two SDM CV approaches were similar, suggesting that model fitting was robust to the CV approach. However, evaluation using spatially independent CV indicated that generalizability of ensemble SDMs to new data ranged from poor to fair for all three species. This suggests that the maximal-area foraging strategy of gadfly petrels (whereby they search opportunistically for resources across expansive oceanic habitats) results in weak or wide associations with environmental features making predicting important habitats extremely challenging.}

abstract = {Trans-Saharan migratory bird species encounter large scale seasonal atmospheric convergence zones, where opposing monsoon and continental air masses meet. These macro-scale atmospheric conditions determine local weather, influence migratory and foraging behaviour and seasonal bird survival rates. Here, we investigate the flight behaviour of pallid swifts Apus pallidus, a small aerial insectivore, in relation to non-breeding season atmospheric conditions using state-of-the-art GPS logged data. Our analysis shows two novel diurnal flight patterns which suggest that pallid swift prey on insects concentrated along frontal convergence zones, in particular the continental Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and a coastal sea-breeze front. Resource use seems not only contingent on the abundance of insects, but also favourable atmospheric conditions. Persistence of swifts in wintering feeding grounds might therefore depend on the prevailing atmospheric conditions and their concentrating effects on insects rather than solely the vegetation state and co-dependent insect populations. Migration events within, to and from, the non-breeding season foraging locations might not only be guided by a decline in vegetation as common metric for prey availability, but also by shifting wind directions and their concentrating effects.},

Female Leach's Storm Petrels Hydrobates leucorhous, nearly monomorphic members of this order, produce eggs that are between 20 and 25\% of adult bodyweight. We tested whether female foraging behaviour differs from male foraging behaviour during the ~ 44-day incubation period across seven breeding colonies in the Northwest Atlantic. Over six breeding seasons, we used a combination of Global Positioning System and Global Location Sensor devices to measure characteristics of individual foraging trips during the incubation period. Females travelled significantly greater distances and went farther from the breeding colony than did males on individual foraging trips. For both sexes, the longer the foraging trip, the greater the distance. Independent of trip duration, females travelled farther, and spent a greater proportion of their foraging trips prospecting widely, as defined by behavioural categories derived from a hidden Markov Model. For both sexes, trip duration decreased with date. Sex differences in these foraging metrics were apparently not a consequence of morphological differences or spatial segregation. Our data are consistent with the idea that female foraging strategies differed from male foraging strategies during incubation in ways that would be expected if females were still compensating for egg formation.},

ABSTRACT={The global population of Leach’s Storm-Petrels (Hydrobates leucorhous), the smallest and most abundant breeding seabird species in eastern Canada, has declined substantially in recent decades. The species is listed as “Threatened” by the Committee On the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) and as “Vulnerable” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fatal attraction to anthropogenic light is a major risk for Leach’s Storm-Petrels and many other nocturnal seabirds. From May to September each year, Leach’s Storm-Petrels in eastern Canada breed in island colonies and travel many hundreds of kilometers to obtain prey for themselves and their chick. At the species’ largest colonies in eastern Newfoundland, brightly illuminated oil production platforms intersect breeding storm-petrels’ foraging paths. The level of risk posed by these platforms is poorly understood. GPS tracking from 2016 to 2021 at one of the world’s largest colonies revealed considerable similarity in foraging trip distance, location, and behavior (inferred from Hidden Markov Models) among years, and a decrease in trip distance and duration between incubation and chick-rearing. Leach’s Storm-Petrels flew within the light catch-basin of an oil platform in 17.5% of trips, and the birds tended to transit rapidly past platforms during the day when light attraction is minimal. Exposure to oil platforms at night occurred in only 1.1% of trips. Despite our findings, Leach’s Storm-Petrels are known to strand on oil platforms in large numbers, especially during the fledging period. In addition, storm-petrels migrate over great distances and are likely exposed to brightly illuminated oceanic oil platforms outside the breeding season. Our results emphasize the need to focus conservation research on risks during migration and winter, and on juveniles and immature birds.}

ABSTRACT={Human activities in the oceans increase the extinction risk of marine megafauna. Interventions require an understanding of movement patterns and the spatiotemporal overlap with threats. We analysed the movement patterns of 33 white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) satellite-tagged in South Africa between 2012 and 2014 to investigate the influence of size, sex and season on movement patterns and the spatial and temporal overlap with longline and gillnet fisheries and marine protected areas (MPAs). We used a hidden Markov model to identify ‘resident’ and ‘transient’ movement states and investigate the effect of covariates on the transition probabilities between states. A model with sex, total length and season had the most support. Tagged sharks were more likely to be in a resident state near the coast and a transient state away from the coast, while the probability of finding a shark in the transient state increased with size. White sharks moved across vast areas of the southwest Indian Ocean, emphasising the need for a regional management plan. White sharks overlapped with longline and gillnet fisheries within 25% of South Africa’s Exclusive Economic Zone and spent 15% of their time exposed to these fisheries during the study period. The demersal shark longline fishery had the highest relative spatial and temporal overlap, followed by the pelagic longline fishery and the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) shark nets and drumlines. However, the KZN shark nets and drumlines reported the highest white shark catches, emphasising the need to combine shark movement and fishing effort with reliable catch records to assess risks to shark populations accurately. White shark exposure to shark nets and drumlines, by movement state, sex and maturity status, corresponded with the catch composition of the fishery, providing support for a meaningful exposure risk estimate. White sharks spent significantly more time in MPAs than expected by chance, likely due to increased prey abundance or less disturbance, suggesting that MPAs can benefit large, mobile marine megafauna. Conservation of white sharks in Southern Africa can be improved by implementing non-lethal solutions to beach safety, increasing the observer coverage in fisheries, and continued monitoring of movement patterns and existing and emerging threats.}

abstract = {Abstract Climate change is modifying the structure of marine ecosystems, including that of fish communities. Alterations in abiotic and biotic conditions can decrease fish size and change community spatial arrangement, ultimately impacting predator species which rely on these communities. To conserve predators and understand the drivers of observed changes in their population dynamics, we must advance our understanding of how shifting environmental conditions can impact populations by limiting food available to individuals. To investigate the impacts of changing fish size and spatial aggregation on a top predator population, we applied an existing agent-based model parameterized for harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena which represents animal energetics and movements in high detail. We used this framework to quantify the impacts of shifting prey size and spatial aggregation on porpoise movement, space use, energetics and population dynamics. Simulated individuals were more likely to switch from area-restricted search to transit behaviour with increasing prey size, particularly when starving, due to elevated resource competition. In simulations with highly aggregated prey, higher prey encounter rates counteracted resource competition, resulting in no impacts of prey spatial aggregation on movement behaviour. Reduced energy intake with decreasing prey size and aggregation level caused population decline, with a 15\% decrease in fish length resulting in total population collapse Increasing prey consumption rates by 42.8 ± 4.5\% could offset population declines; however, this increase was 21.3 ± 12.7\% higher than needed to account for changes in total energy availability alone. This suggests that animals in realistic seascapes require additional energy to locate smaller prey which should be considered when assessing the impacts of decreased energy availability. Changes in prey size and aggregation influenced movements and population dynamics of simulated harbour porpoises, revealing that climate-induced changes in prey structure, not only prey abundance, may threaten predator populations. We demonstrate how a population model with realistic animal movements and process-based energetics can be used to investigate population consequences of shifting food availability, such as those mediated by climate change, and provide a mechanistic explanation for how changes in prey structure can impact energetics, behaviour and ultimately viability of predator populations.},

abstract = {Offshore energy acquisition through the construction of wind farms is rapidly becoming one of the major sources of green energy all over the world. The construction of offshore wind farms contributes to the ocean soundscape as steel monopile foundations are commonly hammered into the seabed to anchor wind turbines. This pile driving activity causes repeated, impulsive, low-frequency sounds, reaching far into the environment, which may have an impact on the surrounding marine life. In this study, we investigated the effect of the construction of 50 wind turbine foundations, over a time span of four months, on the presence and movement behaviour of free-swimming, individually tagged Atlantic cod. The turbine foundations were constructed at a distance ranging between 2.3 and 7.1 km from the cod, which resided in a nearby, existing wind farm in the southern North Sea. Our results indicated that local fish remained in the exposed area during and in-between pile-driving activities, but showed some modest changes in movement patterns. The tagged cod did not increase their net movement activity, but moved closer to the scour-bed (i.e. hard substrate), surrounding their nearest turbine, during and after each piling event. Additionally, fish moved further away from the sound source, which was mainly due to the fact that they were positioned closer to a piling event before its start. We found no effect of the time since the last piling event. Long-term changes in movement behaviour can result in energy budget changes, and thereby in individual growth and maturation, eventually determining growth rate of populations. Consequently, although behavioural changes to pile driving in the current study seem modest, we believe that the potential for cumulative effects, and species-specific variation in impact, warrant more tagging studies in the future, with an emphasis on quantification of energy budgets.}

ABSTRACT={Large-carnivore populations have experienced significant declines in the past centuries in extended parts of the world. Habitat loss, fragmentation, and depletion of natural resources are some of the main causes of this decline. Consequently, behavioral flexibility, enabling the exploitation of anthropogenic food resources in highly disturbed human-dominated landscapes, is becoming critical for the survival of large carnivores. These behavioral changes increase the potential for human-large carnivore conflict and can further intensify carnivore persecution. Here, we examine how land cover types (representing a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance) alter the behavior of striped hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) in a human-dominated landscape in Israel, and whether differences in life history between males and females affect their reaction to such disturbances and consequently their level of exposure to humans. We used a Hidden Markov Model on GPS-tracking data for seven striped hyenas to segment individual-night trajectories into behavioral states (resting, searching, and traveling). We then used multinomial logistic regression to model hyenas’ behavioral state as a function of the interaction between land cover and sex. Females traveled less than males both in terms of average distance traveled per hour, per night, and nightly net displacement. Most steps were classified as “searching” for females and as “traveling” for males. Female hyenas spent a higher proportion of time in human-dominated areas and a lower proportion in natural areas compared to males, and they were also more likely to be found close to settlements than males. Females changed their time allocation between natural and human-dominated areas, spending more time resting than traveling in natural areas but not in human-dominated ones; males spent more time searching than resting in human-dominated areas but were equally likely to rest or search in natural ones. The differences in life history between male and female hyenas may reflect different motivations for space use as a means to optimize fitness, which affects their exposure to humans and therefore their potential involvement in human-hyenas conflict. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to behavioral change in response to human disturbance is important for adaptive management and promoting human large-carnivores co-existence in general.}

Pelagic seabirds have particularly wide-ranging foraging trips, made possible through efficient use of wind. During incubation, partners alternate long periods of fasting and so should adjust foraging and flight decisions according to the condition of the pair, as well as wind conditions experienced at sea. Here, we tracked incubating Juan Fernández petrels, Pterodroma externa, with GPS and immersion loggers, assigned at-sea behaviours using hidden Markov models, and weighed birds and their partners, to investigate the roles of wind and mass on flight and foraging behaviour, and the link between wind use and trip success. Birds conducted long anticlockwise looping trips, on average lasting 20.4 days and covering 10 741 km. They reached a region in the southeastern Pacific Ocean where prey search behaviour was concentrated, typically about 3400 km west of the colony. Outbound and return journeys appeared to broadly benefit from predictable southeasterly trade and westerly winds, respectively. Over finer scales, departure bearings were influenced by wind directions. Across trips, birds oriented predominantly with quartering tail winds which maximized ground speeds. Individuals experienced variable support from tail winds, and those that benefited more on outbound journeys (when winds were generally weaker) travelled faster, reached foraging areas more quickly and, over the entire trip, had higher mass gain per day at sea. Additionally, birds that were lighter on departure gained more mass and birds with heavier partners ranged further from the colony. Our results suggest that decisions involving where to go and how far, respectively, are based on prevailing wind patterns and an assessment of the condition of the pair. Consequently, while birds sought to benefit from wind assistance, those encountering greater tail wind support had more successful foraging trips, indicating that wind use may have direct fitness consequences.}

abstract = {Abstract Behavioural plasticity can allow populations to adjust to environmental change when genetic evolution is too slow to keep pace. However, its constraints are not well understood. Personality is known to shape individual behaviour, but its relationship to behavioural plasticity is unclear. We studied the relationship between boldness and behavioural plasticity in response to wind conditions in wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans). We fitted multivariate hidden Markov models to an 11-year GPS dataset collected from 294 birds to examine whether the probability of transitioning between behavioural states (rest, prey search and travel) varied in response to wind, boldness and their interaction. We found that movement decisions varied with boldness, with bolder birds showing preferences for travel, and shyer birds showing preferences for search. For females, these effects depended on wind speed. In strong winds, which are optimal for movement, females increased time spent in travel, while in weaker winds, shyer individuals showed a slight preference for search, while bolder individuals maintained preference for travel. Our findings suggest that individual variation in behavioural plasticity may limit the capacity of bolder females to adjust to variable conditions and highlight the important role of behavioural plasticity in population responses to climate change.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and its lock-down measures have resulted in periods of reduced human activity, known as anthropause. While this period was expected to be favorable for the marine ecosystem, due to a probable reduction of pollution, shipping traffic, industrial activity and fishing pressure, negative counterparts such as reduced fisheries surveillance could counterbalance these positive effects. Simultaneously, on-land pressure due to human disturbance and tourism should have drastically decreased, potentially benefiting land-breeding marine animals such as seabirds. We analyzed 11 breeding seasons of data on several biological parameters of little penguins from a popular tourist attraction at Phillip Island, Australia. We investigated the impact of anthropogenic activities on penguin behavior during the breeding season measured by (1) distribution at sea, (2) colony attendance, (3) isotopic niche (4) chick meal mass, and (5) offspring investment against shipping traffic and number of tourists. The 2020 lock-downs resulted in a near absence of tourists visiting the Penguin Parade®, which was otherwise visited by 800,000+ visitors on average per breeding season. However, our long-term analysis showed no effect of the presence of visitors on little penguins' activities. Surprisingly, the anthropause did not trigger any changes in maritime traffic intensity and distribution in the region. We found inter- and intra-annual variations for most parameters, we detected a negative effect of marine traffic on the foraging efficiency. Our results suggest that environmental variations have a greater influence on the breeding behavior of little penguins compared to short-term anthropause events. Our long-term dataset was key to test whether changes in anthropogenic activities affected the wildlife during the COVID-19 pandemic.}

abstract = {Shipping is the most pervasive source of marine noise pollution globally, yet its impact on sensitive fauna remains unclear. We tracked 10 harbour porpoises for 5–10 days to determine exposure and behavioural reactions to modelled broadband noise (10 Hz–20 kHz, VHF-weighted) from individual ships monitored by AIS. Porpoises spent a third of their time experiencing ship noise above ambient, to which they regularly reacted by moving away during daytime and diving deeper during night. However, even ships >2 km away (noise levels of 93 ± 14 dB re 1 μPa2) caused animals to react 5–9 % of the time (∼18.6 ships/day). Ships can thus influence the behaviour and habitat use of cetaceans over long distances, with worrying implications for fitness in coastal areas where anthropogenic noise from dense ship traffic repeatedly disrupt their natural behaviour.}

abstract = {Abstract Passive acoustic telemetry can be used within cooperative networks to track migratory species over great distances at a relatively low cost. However, the non-uniform distribution of fixed receivers within networks often results in sporadic detection data. Here, we propose a novel combination of methods to measure the reliability of hot spot analysis results derived from track reconstructions of passive telemetry data. We use an iterative process to simulate tracks of animals, derive detection data from these tracks, and reconstruct tracks from these derived data using a movement model. We then compare quadrat count residuals from the simulated and reconstructed tracks for different grid resolutions. The methodological framework is outlined in detail and tested on the acoustic telemetry cooperative arrays off the US East Coast. Our methods are applied to a subset of blacktip shark, Carcharhinus limbatus, acoustic telemetry detection data collected off the US East Coast. We then apply the resultant quadrat count to a hot spot analysis to determine the distribution of animals derived from these track reconstruction methods. We integrate the results of our methods process with the hot spot analysis results to determine the reliability of this distribution information. The track reconstruction methods performed well in coastal regions, from Palm Beach County, FL to Long Island, NY, minimized the clustering effect of high densities of receivers, and closed the gaps in some regions that were lacking receiver coverage. This performance was primarily affected by the presence/absence of receivers, and to a lesser extent by receiver density and water depth, depending on the grid resolution. Our method combination demonstrates a means by which passive telemetry data can be regularized to determine the spatial distribution of animals across regions with non-uniform sampling coverage. These methods also allow the user to determine the reliability of animal distribution products in a telemetry array and the factors that contribute to high accuracy and precision. Our iterative process enables managers to infer the reliability of ecological results in decision-making processes and could be leveraged for use as a gap analysis to develop a national strategy for telemetry assets.}

    abstract = { Conventional life-history theory predicts that energy-demanding events such as reproduction and migration must be temporally segregated to avoid resource limitation. Here, we provide, to our knowledge, the first direct evidence of ‘itinerant breeding’ in a migratory bird, an incredibly rare breeding strategy (less than 0.1\% of extant bird species) that involves the temporal overlap of migratory and reproductive periods of the annual cycle. Based on GPS-tracking of over 200 female American woodcock, most female woodcock (greater than 80\%) nested more than once (some up to six times) with short re-nest intervals, and females moved northwards on average 800 km between first and second nests, and then smaller distances (ca 200+ km) between subsequent nesting attempts. Reliance on ephemeral habitat for breeding, ground-nesting and key aspects of life history that reduce both the costs of reproduction and migration probably explain the prevalence of this rare phenotype in woodcock and why itinerant breeding so rarely occurs in other bird species. }

ABSTRACT={A unique acoustic call type was identified and attributed to Bryde’s whales in the central North Pacific in 2015, but little is known about the distribution, calling behavior, or swimming behavior of Bryde’s whales in the region. Acoustic detections attributed to Bryde’s whales were used to localize and track individual whales on the U.S. Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) in Kaua‘i, Hawai‘i. This study included 150 acoustically derived tracks from recordings spanning the years 2011–2022 with recording effort in nearly every month. Bryde’s whale movement was examined relative to calendar year, day of year, hour of day, wind speed, and acoustic calling rate. Hidden Markov models were used to identify two kinematic states (slower, less directional movement and faster, more directional movement). The findings indicate that Bryde’s whales were more likely to travel in a faster and more directional state during the daytime than at night and between May and August when compared to other times of year. The along-track acoustic cue rate was examined for 118 tracks, and the findings indicate a possible lengthening of the median inter-call interval over the duration of the study period. These results are an important first step in understanding more about behavior in Bryde’s whales, a relatively under-studied species.}

abstract = {Abstract Understanding the phenology of migration is fundamental to management of migratory gamebirds, in part because of the role migratory timing plays in setting harvest regulations. Migratory timing is particularly important for determining appropriate dates for hunting seasons, which may be selected to coincide with major periods of migration, according to local management objectives. We used global positioning system (GPS)-transmitters to track American woodcock (Scolopax minor), characterize the timing of woodcock migration, and identify sources of variation in timing relative to current hunting season structures in eastern North America. We captured 304 woodcock in 3 Canadian provinces and 12 states from 2017 to 2020, primarily within the Eastern Woodcock Management Region. Using locations collected every 1.7 days on average, we assessed whether initiation, termination, or stopover timing of woodcock migration during fall and early spring varied geographically, differed among age and sex classes, or was influenced by individual body condition. During fall, woodcock migrating from summer use areas farther north and west (e.g., Ontario, Quebec, Canada) initiated and terminated migration earlier than woodcock migrating from areas farther south and east (e.g., Rhode Island, USA). Adult woodcock made multiday stopovers that were 3 days longer on average than juveniles and females made more stopovers on average (8.0 stopovers) compared to males (6.1 stopovers). During the onset of spring migration, woodcock that wintered farther west initiated migration before birds that spent the winter farther east, and males initiated migration on average 6 days earlier than females. Under the current 45-day harvest regulatory framework in the United States, hunting seasons in northern breeding and southern wintering areas are generally consistent with migration phenology. At more intermediate latitudes, however, periods of migration are generally longer than 45 days, resulting in many circumstances where migrating woodcock are present during periods when hunting seasons are closed. Managers in mid-latitude states could consider opening hunting seasons later, allowing hunters to harvest more migrant woodcock.},
